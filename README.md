# Food_Emissions_Proy4

## Introduction
How much you contaminate every time you have a dish in your table?

The food industry is one of the biggest in the world, and is so necesary for us to eat that we dont even think about how much we ar polluting the world by eating.

In this proyect I wanted to see from the most eateds foods how many emissions produce and calculate hows going to be the future for the industry and our world.

## Data Base.

I took most of the data from the "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" and also from kaggle. Could find much information about the production, quantity, area harvested and pollution.

### Emissions DB.

For the emissions data base found in kaggle we have technical information about the quantity of pollution for each type of food. we have: 

- "Eutrophying emissions": Eutrophying emissions represent runoff of excessnutrients into the surrounding environment andwaterways, which affect and pollute ecosystems.
- "Water withdrawals": or water abstractions, are defined as freshwater taken from ground or surface water sources, either permanently or temporarily, and conveyed to a place of use.
- "Greenhouse gases": (also known as GHGs) are gases in the earth's atmosphere that trap heat.
- "Scarcity-weighted water use": represents freshwater useweighted by local water scarcity. This is measured in litersper kilogram of food product.
- "Land use": the total amount of hectars that the production of each food ocupy.

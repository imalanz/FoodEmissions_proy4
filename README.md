# Food_Emissions_Proy4

## Introduction
How much you contaminate every time you have a dish in your table?

The food industry is one of the biggest in the world, and is so necesary for us to eat that we dont even think about how much we ar polluting the world by eating.

In this proyect I wanted to see from the most eateds foods how many emissions produce and calculate hows going to be the future for the industry and our world.
### Process.
- Extract the data information.
- Transform the data into a database and analyse it, by cleaning them so they can match each other, making new columns with more information.
- Import the Data into SQL structure.
- Introduce the data into tableau for a better graphic analysis of the data.

## Data Bases.

I took most of the data from the "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" and also from kaggle. Could find much information about the production, quantity, area harvested and pollution.

### Emissions DB.

For the emissions data base found in kaggle we have technical information about the quantity of pollution for each type of food. we have: 

- "Eutrophying emissions": Eutrophying emissions represent runoff of excessnutrients into the surrounding environment andwaterways, which affect and pollute ecosystems.
- "Water withdrawals": or water abstractions, are defined as freshwater taken from ground or surface water sources, either permanently or temporarily, and conveyed to a place of use.
- "Greenhouse gases": (also known as GHGs) are gases in the earth's atmosphere that trap heat.
- "Scarcity-weighted water use": represents freshwater useweighted by local water scarcity. This is measured in litersper kilogram of food product.
- "Land use": the total amount of hectars that the production of each food ocupy.

### Area harvested DB.

Data base created to detect how many hectars of land each type of food needs for their production, have the data for each year.

### Production quantity DB.
This Data Base have the amount of tonnes produced for each food each year.
### Producer Price.
How much does it cost to produce each type of food, with this table we can see whats the most recomended business for the producers and can make an asumption of what the producers will go for future time. 


## SQL structure.
## Graphic exploration.
